## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kyle!

I use code as a tool to scale businesses. I prefer working with type-safe languages and take testing seriously. I have written code for the cryptocurrency, automotive, and advertising industries. I rarely post public repositories because most of my work is done for private businesses. 

### Here are just a few examples of projects I have worked on:

* [Pista - Multi-Touch Attribution](https://usepista.com?utm_source=github) :rocket:
  * I was responsible for building out the tracking and analytics back-end. The most difficult part of this project was the analytics service because we needed our user's to be able to get immediate insights. Through many interations, we have been able to speed up this service by about 15x.
  * Tech Stack -> Golang, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Elasic Beanstalk, and Cloudwatch.

* Sigy.io - Real-time Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis Alerts :moneybag:
  * The goal of Sigy was to create an easy-to-use, highly configurable, mobile application that would alert users when defined technical threshholds were hit on cryptocurrencies they were following. The most difficult part of this project was managing the all of the concurrent components that would monitor the 400+ coins that our system allowed users to follow.
  * Tech Stack -> Golang, DynamoDB, GraphQL, Elastic Beanstalk, Simple Notification Service, and Cloudwatch.

* FantasyNotify - Fantasy Football Injury Suggester :football:
  * I thought I would throw a fun one in here :smiley:. FantasyNotify would listen for injuries within the NFL, then notify users about the injury along with a suggestion of who to pick up based on the depth-chart of their team.
  * Tech Stack -> Python and MongoDB
