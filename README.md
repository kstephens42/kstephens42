## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kyle!

I use code as a tool to scale businesses. I prefer working with type-safe languages and take testing seriously (sometimes too seriously). I have written code for the cryptocurrency, automotive, and advertising industries. I rarely post public repositories because most of my work is done for private businesses. 

### Here are just a few examples of projects I have worked on:

* [Pista - Multi-Touch Attribution](https://usepista.com?utm_source=github) :rocket:
  * I was responsible for building out the tracking and analytics back-end. The most difficult part of this project was the analytics service because we needed our user's to be able to get immediate insights. Through many interations, we have been able to speed up this service by about 15x.
  * Tech Stack -> Golang, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and a bunch of AWS services.

* Sigy.io - Real-time Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis Alerts :moneybag:
  * The goal of Sigy was to create an easy-to-use, yet highly configurable, mobile application that would alert user's when defined threshholds were hit on cryptocurrencies they were following. The most difficult part of this project was managing the all of the concurrent components that would monitor the 100+ coins that our system allowed user's to follow.
  * Tech Stack -> Golang, DynamoDB, GraphQL, and a bunch of AWS services.

* FantasyNotify - Fantasy Football Injury Suggester :football:
  * I thought I would throw a fun one in here :smiley:. FantasyNotify would listen for injuries within the NFL and then notify user's about the injury and suggest the player that they should pick-up, based on the team's depth-chart.
  * Tech Stack -> Python and MongoDB
